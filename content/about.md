My name is Amirreza Ghaderi. I’m a software developer.

I started this blog simply because i like to write. it helps me to keep my mind clear; I'm one of those people who always keeps a pen and paper around. Its not easy for me to understand or think about something, unless i write it down. It also feels good to share your knowledge with others!

I blogged for many years but this is my first attempt to writing a blog in English—which is not my first language. This blog is mostly about [Functional Programming][fp], [Erlang][erlang], [Elixir][elixir], [Emacs][emacs], [Web][web] ... or any other subject that captures my interest along the way.
